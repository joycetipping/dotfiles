Some configuration files (see the setting:: section of dotfiles.html)

Warning! Do not do this:

$ ./dotfiles.html run

unless you want your dotfiles replaced! If you want to grab individual settings,
you can say things like this:

$ ./dotfiles.html cat setting::.bashrc > temporary-bashrc

Also potentially of use is 'ls':

$ ./dotfiles.html ls ^setting::
