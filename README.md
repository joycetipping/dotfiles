# dotfiles
Released into the public domain for anyone unfortunate enough to share my
sensibilities. This repo exists mostly to make it easier for me to get new
machines working, but it might be a useful starting point for your own dotfiles
(these were started with
[Crunchbang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrunchBang_Linux) defaults).

The background in that screenshot is
[here](http://spencertipping.com/dotfiles-background.jpg).

To install these as your dotfiles:

```sh
$ ./setup yes-really
```

My `.bashrc` sources [dotbash](https://github.com/spencertipping/dotbash), which
it will clone for you if you don't have it already.

The default setup provides several extensions:

- [cd](https://github.com/spencertipping/cd)
- [bashrc-tmux](https://github.com/spencertipping/bashrc-tmux)
- [bash-prompt](https://github.com/spencertipping/bash-prompt)
- [bash-lambda](https://github.com/spencertipping/bash-lambda)

You'll see these being installed from their git repos the first time you run a
new shell with this setup.

Conky config generated by
[conky-compiler](https://github.com/spencertipping/conky-compiler), although
I've stopped using conky since 16.04; it's been broken for a while.

## Things you might not expect out of the box
- [Ridiculously fast key repeat rate](./xinitrc#L6)
- I've disabled right-click for the openbox menu; use `Win+Space` instead
- I use a Thinkpad, so I [disabled the touchpad](./xinitrc#L13)
- There are [no window borders](openbox/rc.xml#L15) (also
  [here](openbox/rc.xml#L233))
- I use `rxvt-unicode` rather than `gnome-terminal` or similar
- Window-resize is `Shift+Alt+Drag`, not `Alt+RightDrag`
- vim has `q` bound to `:x<enter>`, which will save+quit immediately

## Stuff referenced by these configs
...almost all of which are `apt-get install`able.

- `rxvt-unicode`: terminal emulator
- `openbox`: window manager
- `xcompmgr`: compositing for window transparency
- `tmux`: persistent SSH shell sessions
- `xpra`: persistent SSH X forwarding, and much faster than `ssh -X`
- `nitrogen`: set the desktop background
- `audacious`: music player (the openbox config has some shortcuts for this)
- `xsel`: command-line access to X clipboard
- `gmrun`: pop up window to run stuff
- `chromium-browser`: because I can't be bothered to install proper chrome
- `transset`: set baseline transparency of a window, for compositing
- `shutter`: take screenshots

If you want the 10x10 matrix of workspaces, you'll need to have
[`setlayout`](http://openbox.org/dist/tools/setlayout.c) in your `$PATH`
somewhere.

## Openbox keybindings
These are pretty much all custom, but I've been using them for a few years and
like the way they work. Almost every shortcut uses the `Win` key.
